The protocol shown above (Stitching Images with Pix4Dmapper), started as a folder called “Pix4Dmapper_Stitch” that looks like this:\n\n\nOpen RStudio and create a new Quarto Document. \nYou’ll see a pop up like this. You can title it now or handle that later.\n\n\n\nRStudio has two visualizing options. Visual and Source. Both are useful but I’d recommend using Visual most of the time.\nVisual:\n\n\nSource:\n\n\nThe ![](Picture1.png) won’t be treated properly if it’s pasted in while RStudio is in “Visual” mode. You can switch into “Source” to correct this or click on the small image icon by “Format” to insert an image.\nThere’s the stitching protocol after I converted it to a Quarto document. One thing to notice is that font color takes some effort. The text that was red in the word document is surrounded by &lt;font color=\"red\"&gt; and &lt;/font&gt;. When this page is converted into html this will be processed and show up nicely (but not until then).\nVisual:\n\n\nSource:\n\n\nSave your file as index.qmd in the same folder as the images for the file.\nFinally, zip this folder and send it to be added to the site!"

Using a container will allow the same code to run on an HPC, but for purely local analysis a virtual environment (e.g. using conda, mamba, renv, or packrat) will do just fine. This guide supposes you have an analysis developed in a virtual environment (here I assume using conda) that needs to be containerized to run on a different machine.\nTo start out, we need to export our environment’s packages to a .yml file (gpu.yml). For this example I’m using the gpu environment and export the requirements file below.\nNext, we create a .def file (gpu.def) that contains conda and will download the specified requirements.\nBuild the container like so:\nAnd then we can test that the default python is conda …\n… and that it still can access the host gpus."

Along the way we’ll talk about…\n\nWhat deep learning models do\nHow deep learning models are trained\nArchitectural decisions to improve performance\nTools used for model development and refinement\n\nAlong the way we’ll also talk a fair bit about python, the logistical challenges that surround model training, and some of the ways models can learn the wrong things.\nWe’re interested in building understanding and intuition so as to avoid cases where you only think your model is working well. We’re going to encourage twin prescriptions of skepticism and caution in working with models. Instead of “move fast and break things” think “move slow and build things”."

Initially we’ll have a presentations coving foundational topics which will give way to open discussions. Having a list of thoughts and questions will be valuable to make the most of these sessions.\nSince it’s really hard to train models on paper, we expect folks to be writing (and debugging) code. We recommend budgeting time for the videos and writing exploratory code on your own. It can be useful to write the code featured in the videos in parallel with them, which may substantially increase the amount of time the material requires (and one’s comfort and fluency with these topics). Futher, applying or extending what you have seen to small data sets is a great way to solidify understanding.\nFinally, we recommend identifying at least one peer that you can partner with. Explaining a new concept is a great way to solidify your understanding and having someone you can ask for a fresh perspective from is hugely useful. Although we’re interested in technical knowledge, we also want to increase connections between labs and the folks in them.\nIn summary:\n\nKeep an eye on the upcoming materials\nWrite code, make mistakes, debug code\nMake friends, ask for help, and teach others"

It should take only a few minutes to get set up, but please go ahead and do this before our kickoff meeting next week. That way we can address any issues that arise.\nTo start out with we’ll use python through jupyter notebooks. If you’ve worked in the R ecosystem, these are similar to Rmarkdown or quarto documents that let you mix notes and equations in with your code. There are two options you can use. The easiest is to use “Google Collab” which will take care of the setup for you. The hardware your notebook will not be especially powerful but that is perfectly fine for starting out.\nOption 1: • Create a google account if you don’t have one. • Keep this url handy for next week https://colab.research.google.com/ Option 2: • Install Anaconda https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/ or miniconda https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html • Using either the graphical interface or the command line https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html# create an environment and ensure that at least Jupiter is installed https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jupyter\nAssuming you opt for option 2 with the graphical user interface, select environments\n\nNext select create\n\nSelect python and choose a name for your environment. (Don’t worry about the version of python just now, we’ll change it when or if it becomes an issue)\n\nNow we need to install jupyter notebook. By default anaconda displays the installed packages so we’ll need to switch to all or uninstalled before searching for it. Find it, check the box and press apply below.\n\nYou may see a pop up requesting that you install notebook’s dependencies.\n\nAfter the installation if finished now you can right click on the play symbol and launch a jupyter notebook.\n\nThis should automatically launch in your default browser."

    "text": "Learning PostgreSQL On The Way Down:\nI considered using duckdb for it’s speed and simplicity but ultimately elected to use PostgreSQL since it’s been around longer (1996) and boasts limits way beyond what I need. Please don’t take the below as best practice or even recommendations per se as this is the first non-SQLite database I’ve administered. This is just notes on the stumbling blocks I encountered. The best thing one can do is read the official PostgreSQL tutorial. Several times I searched for the solution to a problem just to find it covered a few pages later.\nInstallation (in this case on ubuntu via apt) was easy but database creation takes some doing. PostgreSQL defines accounts that are separate from the host system. This includes a special account postgres with root permisions that is initially available. Using sudo -u postgres &lt;cmd&gt; one can run commands as if this account existed on the host machine.\nWe use this account to create the database and then login as root.\nsudo -u postgres createdb apsimxsim\nsudo -u postgres psql\nNext we create a non-root account and provide permissions2 for the apsimxsim database and public schema.\npostgres=# CREATE ROLE loremipsum LOGIN PASSWORD 'TotallyRealPassword';\nCREATE ROLE\npostgres=# ALTER ROLE loremipsum CREATEDB;\nALTER ROLE\npostgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE apsimxsim TO loremipsum;\nGRANT\napsimxsim=# GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO loremipsum;\nGRANT\nWe can check permissions using \\du (note that psql specific commands begin with \\ e.g., \\q).\npostgres=# \\du\n                             List of roles\n Role name |                         Attributes\n-----------+------------------------------------------------------------\n loremipsum     | Create DB\n postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS\nWe’re not done with setup yet. We also need to change the search path for the loremipsum user so we can find our tables.\n$psql apsimxsim\napsimxsim=&gt; SET search_path TO public;\nNow we should be set. We can add / drop tables from psql but we’re going to use python’s SQLAlchemy library to do most of the heavy lifting including creating these tables.\nFast forwarding a little, here’s what we’re aiming at. Ultimately the loremipsum user will own three tables with the metadata (ids, genotypes) and simulated results (results). A final quirk I’ll mention here is that it’s possible to use capitalized names but it a bit of a hasle. We’d have to select them as public.\"Ids\" instead of public.ids. For this reason we’ll standardized all table and field names using only lowercase letters and underscores.\napsimxsim=&gt; SELECT schemaname, tablename, tableowner FROM pg_tables WHERE tableowner='loremipsum';\n schemaname | tablename | tableowner\n------------+-----------+------------\n public     | ids       | loremipsum\n public     | genotypes | loremipsum\n public     | results   | loremipsum\n(3 rows)"

We can’t retrieve data without inserting it so in reality I’m showing things a little out of order. Bear with me and it’ll all fit together.\nThankfully getting data from SQL to python isn’t a new problem so there should be many workable solutions (e.g. discussion, asyncpg, warp_prism).\nWe’re going to start simple and use sqlalchemy with psycopg2 to connect to the database.\nUltimately we’ll have something like this:\nimport psycopg2\nfrom   sqlalchemy import create_engine, text\n\nengine = create_engine(\n        \"db_string_here\"\n        )\n\nwith engine.connect() as conn:\n    result = conn.execute(\n      text('SELECT * FROM public.ids LIMIT 1')\n      )\nOnce we have result we can transform it into a tensor and be set.

    "text": "Data Migration & Ad Hoc Parallelism\nWhen writing to the database we want to append to the table if it already exists. This means that if the script is disrupted we run the risk of writing duplicate rows when the script runs again.\nIf we keep track of what files have been processed, it’s a short jump to enabling parallelism. The approach we’ll take is to…\n\nIdentify all files to be imported\nCheck if a file has already been processed\nCheck if a file is being worked on by another process\nWrite to a log which file is going to be processed\nProcess file\nWrite to a log that the file has finished being processed\n\nThese steps will be in the script parquet_to_psql.py so we can easily run this from the command line.\nWe’ll use os.listdir to find all the files in the target directory then filter the files with re to get those that follow a naming convention sim_######_######.parquet.\n# Identify files to add\nparquet_path = '/path/to/parquet_files/'\n\n# constrain to the parquets that exist in the path\nexisting_parquet = [e for e in os.listdir(parquet_path) if re.match('sim_\\d+_\\d+\\.parquet', e)]\nWe’ll use a simple list saved to a json file to track what files have been processed already and use it to exclude these entries from our queue.\nfinished_parquet = [] \nif os.path.exists('./finished_parquet.json'):\n    with open('./finished_parquet.json', 'r') as f:\n        finished_parquet = json.load(f)\n\nexisting_parquet = [e for e in existing_parquet if e not in finished_parquet]\nNow we’ll iterate over some number of the un-processed files but we’ll use the same trick to check if the parquet is being worked on by another instance of this script. The main difference between finished_parquet.json and reserved_parquet.json is that the latter we’ll update as soon as we confirm the parquet we’re considering (variable e) isn’t reserved. After processing we’ll log that the file has been processed.\nnum_parquets = 3 # How many files to process per run\nfor e in existing_parquet[0:num_parquets]: \n    # so that we can run this process in parallel we'll track which files have been reserved\n    reserved_parquet = []\n    if os.path.exists('./reserved_parquet.json'):\n        with open('./reserved_parquet.json', 'r') as f:\n            reserved_parquet = json.load(f)\n            \n    if e in reserved_parquet:\n        pass\n    else:\n        # log that this entry reserved\n        reserved_parquet.append(e)\n        with open('./reserved_parquet.json', 'w') as f:\n            json.dump(reserved_parquet, f)\n            \n        # Process File\n        # ...\n\n        # After completion, log that the file has been processed\n        finished_parquet.append(e)\n        with open('./finished_parquet.json', 'w') as f:\n            json.dump(finished_parquet, f)\n        print('\\n')  \nOne additional quirk is worth noting. There are a ton of records in some of these files – enough to cause the process to stall out. To get around this we’re going to break the dataframe into blocks of 1,000,000 rows and write each separately (There’s certainly a better way to achieve this, but hey, it works.)\nWith all that done we can run python ./parquet_to_psql.py and it’ll take care of the migration for us!"

    "text": "Simplified Example\nHere’s an example: I’m building a network that ‘compresses’ information. The key idea is that there’s a function, f(), takes in some number of values and outputs fewer values. We can use this function over and over again to compress the values more and more. Once they’re ‘compressed’ we can do the reverse procedure and get more values until we’re back at the starting number.\nThere’s a catch however, and that’s that the function can only output an integer number of values even if the number should be a fraction. It’s like this division function. If the numerator argument is the number of input values and it will return numerator/3 values.\n\ndiv_it &lt;- function(numerator, divisor = 3){\n  res = numerator/divisor\n  res = round(res)\n  return(res)\n}\n\ndiv_it(100)\n\n[1] 33\n\n\nBecause it can only return whole numbers, we can’t reverse this procedure and always get back the same number – sometimes we have to add or subtract a little bit.\n\ninv_div_it &lt;- function(numerator, divisor = 3){\n  return(numerator*divisor)\n}\n\ninv_div_it(33)\n\n[1] 99\n\ninv_div_it(33)+1\n\n[1] 100\n\n\nIf we want to really compress the input (f(X) |&gt; f(X) |&gt; f(X) |&gt; f(X) or f(f(f(f(X))))) then the number of values at each level would be:\n\nvals &lt;- c(100)\nfor(i in 1:4){\n  i_val &lt;- vals[length(vals)]\n  vals[length(vals)+1] &lt;- div_it(i_val) \n}\nvals\n\n[1] 100  33  11   4   1\n\n\nIdeally running the inverse procedure multiple times on the last output above (just one value) would output produce:\n\nvals_reverse &lt;- vals[length(vals):1]\nvals_reverse\n\n[1]   1   4  11  33 100\n\n\nBut using the inverse function defined above (inv_div_it()) we get:\n\nrecover_vals &lt;- c(1)\nfor(i in 1:4){\n  i_val &lt;- recover_vals[length(recover_vals)]\n  recover_vals[length(recover_vals)+1] &lt;- inv_div_it(i_val) \n}\nrecover_vals\n\n[1]  1  3  9 27 81\n\n\nTo get back to 100 values we need to add a new value (imagine appending a 1 to an array) sometimes, and drop a value others, or make no change to output other times.\n\nadd_vals &lt;- c(1, -1, 0, 1)\n\nrecover_vals &lt;- c(1)\nfor(i in 1:4){\n  i_val &lt;- recover_vals[length(recover_vals)]\n  print(add_vals[i])\n  recover_vals[length(recover_vals)+1] &lt;- inv_div_it(i_val) + add_vals[i]\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] -1\n[1] 0\n[1] 1\n\nrecover_vals\n\n[1]   1   4  11  33 100\n\n\nWe could keep track of the remainder each time f() is called and use that to figure out when to add or subtract 1. That would be the elegant and efficient solution. We know the desired output (100 values) and the number of times f() was called (4) so we could also try changing the numbers in add_vals until we have four numbers that. This solution would be inelegant but still effective.\nIf a piece of code only needs to be a few times then the cost of the time you’d spend optimizing it will probably be worth more than than cost of the time the computer spends running it (see also).\nIf the sloppy way to express what you want is good enough then don’t worry about it. Good enough now is often better than perfect later."

    "text": "Example in Context (python)\nThe motivating problem behind this write up is that ‘compressing’ weather data (17 measurements for 365 days) into fewer values. I’m using a variation autoencoder with convolution layers which you can imagine as passing a sliding window over a 17x365 grid and summarizing each windowed chunk to get fewer values.\nTo check if the compression is effective, we have to compress 17x365 values down to something smaller (e.g. 17x23), and inflate them back to 17x365 so we can compare the input weather to the output weather. If we can get back the same 17x365 values (or something pretty close) then the comprssion is effective..\nFrom the input data’s length (days) you can calculate what a convolutional layer’s output length will be like so:\ndef L_out_conv1d(\n    L_in = 365, \n    kernel_size=3, stride = 2, padding=1, dilation = 1\n): return ((L_in +2*padding-dilation*(kernel_size-1)-1)/stride)+1\n\nL_out_conv1d(L_in = 365) # 183.0\nAnd the same for reversing the operation (with a transposed convolution).\ndef L_out_convT1d(\n    L_in = 183, \n    kernel_size=3, stride = 2, padding=1, output_padding=0, dilation = 1\n): return (L_in - 1)*stride-2*padding+dilation*(kernel_size-1)+output_padding+1\n\nL_out_convT1d(L_in = 183) # 365.0\nThe trouble is that if I stack convolution layers the output length can become a fraction, which is forced to an integer, and prevents the reverse operation from producing the right number. When I use 4 layers the length should be [365, 183.0, 92.0, 46.5, 23.75] which as integers is [365, 183, 92, 46, 23]. Reversing the operation produces [23, 45, 89, 177, 353].\nWe can get back to 365 days by increasing the output’s length in some of the transposed convolution layers by adding a non-zero output_padding. I don’t know how many layers will be best, so I can’t hard code these values. I could use the functions above to calculate what when the output_padding should be 0 and when it shouldn’t (the elegant solution), but that’s not what I did.\nInstead I made a simple disposable neural network just to check if I had the output_paddings right by tracking the lengths of the tensor after each layer.\n# input data.

A node’s input should be the number of SNPs in a gene (if it’s an input node) or the sum of the outputs of the nodes on which it depends (e.g. y_hat’s input size is the sum of c1 and c2’s outputs). To do this, I’m going to copy the dictionary with all the connections between nodes, then swap the node names for their output sizes. Summing the list of these output values will be the required input size. Data nodes don’t depend on input from other nodes, so those will have an input shape of 0.\n\ninput_size_dict = node_connections.copy()\n\nno_dependants = [e for e in node_connections.keys() if node_connections[e] == []]\n\n# use the expected output sizes from `output_size_dict` to fill in the non-data sizes\ntensor_ndim = len(input_tensor_dict[list(input_tensor_dict.keys())[0]].shape)\nfor e in tqdm(input_size_dict.keys()):\n    # overwrite named connections with the output size of those connections\n    # if the entry is in no_dependants it's data so it's size needs to be grabbed from the input_tensor_dict\n    input_size_dict[e] = [\n        (list(input_tensor_dict[ee].shape)[1]*list(input_tensor_dict[ee].shape)[2]) \n        if ee in no_dependants\n        else output_size_dict[ee] for ee in input_size_dict[e]]\n\n# Now walk over entries and overwrite with the sum of the inputs\nfor e in tqdm(input_size_dict.keys()):\n    input_size_dict[e] = np.sum(input_size_dict[e])\n    \ninput_size_dict\n# output\n{'y_hat': 40,\n 'c1': 20,\n 'c2': 20,\n 'b1': 32,\n 'b2': 8,\n 'a1_input': 0.0,\n 'a2_input': 0.0}\n\nNow we can update the graph from above adding in the input/output sizes."

Specifically, my results suggest that using a weighted average to make accurate models more influential. To do this, the predictions from each model are multiplied by the inverse of the model’s root mean squared error (rmse) of the model and summed. Someone helping me improve this manuscript thought that instead I should be weighting by the inverse of the model’s variance. This is a reasonable expectation (variance weighting is beautifully explained here) so I needed to convince my collaborator before the manuscript was ready for the world – Here’s how I did this with in a simulation that was only about 100 lines1 of R code."

We can simulate as many samples as we would like from this system over a range of xs.\n\nn = 100 # samples to be generated\nxs &lt;- seq(0, 20, length.out = n) # x values evenly spaced from 0-20 \nys &lt;- 0+1*xs\n\nHere’s the simulated “data”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can simulate models that are trying to predict y. To do this we’ll think of a model as being equivalent to the true value of y plus some model specific error. If we assume that the models aren’t prone to systematically over or underestimating, then we can use a normal distribution to generate these errors like so:\n\nmean1 =  0 # error doesn't tend to be over or under\nvar1  =  1 # variance of the error\ny1 &lt;- ys + rnorm(n = n, mean = mean1, sd = sqrt(var1))\n\nWe can simulate a better model by decreasing the variance (errors are consistently closer to the mean of 0). Conversely we can simulate a worse model by making the model tend to over or undershoot by changing the mean or make larger errors more common by increasing the varience. Here’s a model that’s worse than the previous one.\n\nmean2 =  1 # predictions tend to overshoot\nvar2  = 10 # larger errors are more common\ny2 &lt;- ys + rnorm(n = n, mean = mean2, sd = sqrt(var2))\n\nLet’s look at the predictions from model y1 and model y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see that y1’s error (vertical lines) are considerably smaller than that of y2.\nWe can subtract the true value \\(y\\) from the predicted value \\(\\hat y\\) to see this more clearly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn panel B we can see the difference between the two error distributions for the models (save a few irregularities in these distributions from only using 100 samples.\nNow we can try out different averaging schemes to cancel out some of the error and get a better prediction. We can test a simple average like so.\n\ne1 &lt;- 0.5*y1 + 0.5*y2\n\nWe can also try placing more weight on models with less variable predictions (and hopefully smaller errors).\n\nyhat_vars  &lt;- unlist(map(list(y1, y2), function(e){var(e)})) # Calculate variance for each model's predictions\nwght_vars  &lt;- (1/yhat_vars)/sum(1/yhat_vars) # Take the inverse and get percent weight by dividing by the sum \ne2 &lt;- wght_vars[1]*y1  + wght_vars[2]*y2 # Scale each model's prediction and add to get the weighted average.\n\nWe can also try placing more weigh on models that are more accurate2.\n\nyhat_rmses &lt;- unlist(map(list(y1, y2), function(e){sqrt((sum((ys-e)**2)/n))}))\nwght_rmses &lt;- (1/yhat_rmses)/sum(1/yhat_rmses)\ne3 &lt;- wght_rmses[1]*y1 + wght_rmses[2]*y2\n\nNow we can calculate the RMSE for both models and these weighed averages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ny_rmse\nmean1\nmean2\nvar1\nvar2\n\n\n\n\ny1\n1.023765\n0\n1\n1\n10\n\n\ny2\n3.218318\n0\n1\n1\n10\n\n\nunif\n1.796390\n0\n1\n1\n10\n\n\nvar\n1.670037\n0\n1\n1\n10\n\n\nrmse\n1.217204\n0\n1\n1\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny1 is the best set of predictions, averaging did not benefit predicitons here. This is not too much of a shock since y2 was generated by a model that was prone to systematically overshooting the true value and was more likely to have bigger errors.\nBut how would these results change if the models were more similar? What if the models had more similar error variences? Or if one was prone to overshooting while the other was prone to undershooting?"

These differences can be are easier to think about visually. Here are the four “flavors” of model that we would like to combine to test all combinations of accuracy and precision.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, We’ll have one model that acting as a stable reference and vary the error of the other (y2). We’ll make a version of the y2 model that is accurate (the mean error is only shifted by 0.01) and one that is inaccurate (the mean error is shifted by 50). Then we’ll see what happens when these two go from being precise (variance around 0.01) to very imprecise (variance up to 100).\nIn R this is expressed as below. When the mean of the error (mean_shift) is near zero accuracy is high. When the variance of the error (var_shift) is near zero precision is high.\n\nparams &lt;- expand.grid(\n  mean_shift = seq(0.01, 50, length.out = 2),\n  var_shift = c(seq(0.01, 0.99, length.out = 50), seq(1, 100, length.out = 90))\n)\n\nThis results in quite a few (280) combinations. of parameters Let’s look at the first and last few:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean_shift\nvar_shift\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.01\n0.01000\n\n\n2\n50.00\n0.01000\n\n\n3\n0.01\n0.03000\n\n\n278\n50.00\n98.88764\n\n\n279\n0.01\n100.00000\n\n\n280\n50.00\n100.00000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we’ll generate the results. This code may look confusing at first. Here’s what it’s doing. 1. run_sim executes the steps we did above, using the parameters we specified in params to generate 100,000 observations and calculate the expected RMSE of each approach. 1. map is a way of looping over some input and putting all of the results into a list. In this case we’re looping over all the the rows in params so we will end up with a list containing a data.frame for each of the 280 parameter combinations. 1. rbind will combine two data.frames, ‘stacking’ one on top of the other. However, it can’t use a list as input so… 1. we have to use do.call. It will iteratively apply a function (rbind) to the entries in a list so that all the simulation results end up in one big data.frame.\n\nsim_data &lt;- do.call(         # 4.\n  rbind,                     # 3\n  map(seq(1, nrow(params)),  # 2.\n      function(i){           \n        run_sim(             # 1.\n          n = 10000,\n          mean1 = 0,\n          mean2 = unlist(params[i, 'mean_shift']), \n          var1 = 1,\n          var2 = unlist(params[i, 'var_shift']))\n      })\n)\n\nOnce this runs we can look at the results. Let’s consider the high accuracy y2 first, starting where y2’s variance is less than or equal to y1’s variance (1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen y2’s variance is very small (&lt; ~0.2) it outperforms all other estimates (just like the previous simulation). As it increases it crosses the line for \\(rmse^{-1}\\) weighting (rmse, orange line) and then the other averaging schemes before converging with y1 (dashed blue line). Over the same span \\(rmse^{-1}\\) converges with \\(var^{-1}\\) (var, red line), and the simple average (unif, black line).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs y2 continues to worsen, every prediction (except those from y1) get worse and worse. What’s interesting is that this doesn’t happen at the same rate. Because \\(rmse^{-1}\\) weighting penalizes predictions from models based on accuracy its error grows much more slowly than \\(var^{-1}\\) weighting or uniform weighting.\nTo summarize – If two models are equally good (1 on the y axis) then using any of the averaging strategies here will be better than not averaging. If one is far and away better than the other then it’s best to ignore the worse one. In practice one might find they have models that are performing in the same ballpark of accuracy. These results would suggest that in that case one gets the best results by \\(rmse^{-1}\\) weighting.\nNow let’s add in the case where one model is highly inaccurate. In this case, as precision worsens y2 (top blue line) has higher error but this is hard to see given just how much error it has to begin with. Uniform weighting follows a similar trend (but lessened by half) while \\(var^{-1}\\) improves as y2 becomes more imprecise because this decreases it’s influence on the final prediction. Of the averages \\(rmse^{-1}\\) is the best by a country mile because it accounts for the inaccuracy of y2 right from the start."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A collaborator and I just talked through how one might compare two sets of p values. We’re thinking about the following approach.\nSetup: You have two replicates of an experiment (r1, r2). In each experiment you measured three mRNAs (a, b, c) in control and treatment (c, t). You want to know if the same trends in r1 show up in r2 but there is a batch effect that will prevent comparing them directly (e.g. you can’t run a t test on r1 _a_ c and r2 _a_ c )\nProposed Solution:\n\nCompare each mRNA within a replicate and note the sign of change and if the p value reached a pre-determined cutoff (we lose some information doing this since we’re pooling 0.06 and 0.99 together)\n\nrep  |mrna |sign |pval |sig  |\nr1   | a   | -   |0.04 |1    |\nr1   | b   | +   |0.10 |0    |\n...  |     |     |     |     |\nr2   | c   | -   |0.02 |1    |\n\nMultiply the sign by the significance code so that -1 = “significant decrease”, 0 = “no significant change”, +1 = “significant increase”\n\nrep  |mrna |sign |pval |sig  |sxp  |\nr1   | a   | -   |0.04 |1    |+1   |\nr1   | b   | +   |0.10 |0    |0    |\n...  |     |     |     |     |     |\nr2   | c   | -   |0.02 |0    |-1   |\n\nReshape these as two vectors and treat them as categorical data. Then compare the “assignment” between these two lists using a jaccard index as if we were comparing an assignment from clustering against reality.\n\nr1 &lt;- as.character(c(1, 0, 0))\nr2 &lt;- as.character(c(0, 0, -1))\njaccard(r1, r2)\n\nUse resampling to find an empirical p value for this observed jaccard index.\n\nDoes that seem reasonable? Is there another way you would go about it? (Email me what you think!)\nHere’s an implementation for two sets of correlations. Here we bin the correlations into 5 bins use a jaccard index to assess whether the bin assignments are the same for both datasets (Brian’s and mine). To confirm that the measured jaccard index (0.23) isn’t anything to write home about we can generate an empirical p value (ep = 0.13).\n# cor_comp_df\n#\n#    Source Time     x     y        Corr\n#    &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n#  1 Person1  Baseline bkkca cav1    0.441\n#  2 Person1  Baseline bkkca cav2    0.476\n#  3 Person1  Baseline bkkca inx1    0.435\n#  4 Person1  Baseline bkkca inx2    0.159\n#  5 Person1  Baseline bkkca inx3   -0.174\n#  6 Person1  Baseline bkkca inx4   -0.167\n\nn_bins &lt;- 5\n\ntemp &lt;- cor_comp_df %&gt;% \n  mutate(Bins = cut(Corr, breaks = seq(-1, 1, length.out = n_bins))) %&gt;% \n  select(-Corr) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"Source\", values_from = \"Bins\")\n\n# temp\n#\n#   Time     x     y     Person1    Person2  \n#   &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;   \n# 1 Baseline bkkca cav1  (0,0.5]  (0,0.5] \n# 2 Baseline bkkca cav2  (0,0.5]  (0,0.5] \n# 3 Baseline bkkca inx1  (0,0.5]  (0.5,1] \n# 4 Baseline bkkca inx2  (0,0.5]  (0.5,1] \n# 5 Baseline bkkca inx3  (-0.5,0] (0.5,1] \n# 6 Baseline bkkca inx4  (-0.5,0] (-0.5,0]\n\n\nlibrary('clusteval')\nobs_jaccard &lt;- cluster_similarity(temp$Person1, temp$Person2, similarity=\"jaccard\")  \n\n# 0.2304234\n\nnull_jaccard &lt;- map(1:10000, function(i){\n  cluster_similarity(sample(temp$Person1, replace = F), \n                     temp$Person2, similarity=\"jaccard\")\n  }) %&gt;% \n  unlist()\n\n\ntemp &lt;- with(density(null_jaccard), data.frame(x, y))\ntemp &lt;- temp %&gt;% mutate(xmax = max(x),\n                obs = obs_jaccard)\n\nggplot(data = temp, aes(x = x, y = y))+\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = obs_jaccard)+\n  geom_ribbon(data = temp[temp$x &gt; temp$obs, ], \n              aes(xmin = obs, xmax = xmax, ymin = 0, ymax = y))+\n  labs(subtitle = paste(\"empirical p=\", as.character(mean(null_jaccard &gt;= obs_jaccard))))\n\n\n\nimage (22).png\n\n\nIt’s worth generating an empirical p value for each comparison you’re making. For example here I’m comparing the results of an experiment replicate. Each dependent variable is assigned a group based on if one would conclude it there was a difference (0 or 1) between groups and the sign of that difference (+ or -). Seeing a Jaccard index of 0.61 (out of 1) we might conclude we replicated most of the findings. However, the empirical p value is 1 because most of the comparisons were non-significant in both groups resulting in a high floor for the index."

    "title": "unlist is handy and you should use it",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Y’all should be using unlist(). unlist is a crazy handy function when you pair it with the purrr library. It’ll take a list and try to give you a vector. Strictly speaking it’s probably best to be using map_dbl() or map_chr() instead but let’s not worry about that at the moment.\nWhy do I love unlist so much? Because unlist(map( )) gives you a flexible, effective way to iterate (that is parallel friendly with minor changes).\nHere’s an example: I have a bunch of traces in a folder and I need to know if there are any experiments that didn’t copy. Additionally, I’d like to know what kind of data is in the file. I could look through them one by one, but that’s no fun. Thankfully, R has functions that perform similarly to shell functions. (More on these some other time.)\nSo we start by defining a data.frame with all file names and their sizes. Note that calling unlist(map()) inside data.frame() lets us do a lot work very quickly. We find all the files, get information about each one, and then selectively return the size.\ntraces_dir &lt;- \"C:/Users/Daniel/Documents/Trace_Holding\"\n\nfiles_df &lt;- data.frame(files = list.files(traces_dir),\n                       bytes = unlist(map(list.files(traces_dir), \n                                          function(abf){ &lt;http://file.info|file.info&gt;(paste0(traces_dir, \"/\",abf))$size })))\n\n#              files    bytes\n# 1 190808a_0000.abf 15006208 &lt;- long gap free recording\n# 2 190808a_0001.abf 15006208\n# 3 190808a_0002.abf 15006208\nThe experiment is embedded in the file name for each. Once again , with a little help from unlist we can split the file names into a list of list (i.e. \"190808a_0000.abf\" becomes [[1]] [[1]] \"190808a\" [[2]] \"0000.abf\" select only the first part and populate a new column.\nfiles_df$Experiment &lt;- unlist(transpose(str_split(files_df$files, pattern = \"_\"))[[1]])\nOkay, now we can make use of this. I’ve defined a data.frame for metadata about the experiments.\nfile_groups\n#    Experiment       Group\n# 1      190924    Baseline\n# ... \n# 19     190918     Delayed\nWe can join these data frames and apply a little tidyverse magic to see what experiments are missing (we could also compare the sets of experiments directly).\nfull_join(file_groups, files_df) %&gt;% \n  filter(&lt;http://is.na|is.na&gt;(files)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(Group, Experiment) %&gt;% \n  tally()\n\n#  Experiments that didn't transfer:\n\n#   Group       Experiment     n\n# 1 Baseline    190924         1\n# 2 Baseline    190924a        1\n# ...\nWe can repeat the same strategy to programattically look at the protocol types (e.g. based on file size or channel number via &lt;http://file.info|file.info&gt; | readABF()). Moral of the story, you should so stop applying yourself and give unlist and purrr functions a try."

    "text": "If you run into a situation where you’re using a ton of memory (e.g. manipulating transcriptomic data, resampling, or working with electrophysiology traces) use rm() to selectively get rid off objects in the environment. A useful pattern is to write out large objects you’ll need in the future, remove them, and then read them back in when you need them. This is usually not important, but when it is, it is.\nIf you’re working interactively and tempted to use rm(list = ls()) consider restarting your r session (ctrl+shift+F10 on windows). Overreliance on rm(list = ls()) is poor form.\nA side note – unlike listing items where the function matching the unix command acts on the environment and a new command acts on the files system (ls() and list.files()) the functions for removing items don’t follow this logic. rm() acts on objects in your environment whereas unlink() acts on system files.\nSimilarly if you want to retain only specific objects you can take this approach:\n # get rid of everything\nrm(list=ls())\n\n# get rid of everything except specific objects and all loaded functions\nrm(list = \n   ls()[!(ls() %in% c(\n   # objects\n   c(\"data1\", \"data2\", \"bool1\", \"list1\"), \n   # functions\n   lsf.str())\n   ) ])"

If you’re running an analysis that has a time consuming step you can save the result as a python readable “pickle” file.

    "text": "A recent example:\nI’m writing a model that uses relationships between genes to predict a trait. The problem is that the model isn’t something I can write by hand (there are 6,067 inputs) and is way to slow – I’ve estimated it would take about 1.7 days to complete a single epoch (training cycle).\n\n\n\nHere are all the model’s processes for just two input genes.\n\n\nIn the diagram above, data from each gene (the nodes at the top) is fed into different functions (nodes 0-23) representing associations between different biological processes until they reach the output node (24) which predicts the trait.\nSome nodes share the same input (here node 14 and 10 both need node 11 as input). Under the hood I have the model storing the output of these nodes so it doesn’t have to re-calculate outputs un-necessarily (here the model would look-up the output of node 11 instead of recalculating it). This seems to work nicely but is a little unusual – in over two years this is the first time I’ve manually done this sort of thing.\nBecause of that, when I move my model from a tiny demo data set to the real thing and saw it was slow as molasses I “knew” my model slow because it was storing and retrieving intermediate results.\nOne assumption underlying this is that the model library is effectively designed and optimized such that it’s easier to get worse performance by doing unconventional things than better performance. This isn’t a bad assumption most of the time but we’ll see how it got me thinking about the wrong problem. My thought process went something like this:\n“Okay, so I’m doing something a little unconventional by looking up module outputs. Maybe if I can rewrite the model without this, some ☆Pytorch magic☆ will happen improving training speed.”\n“Hmm, the most straightforward way to write a model would be to chain the inputs and outputs like so”\ninput_1 = x_list[0]\nmodule_2 = x_list[1]\nintermediate_1 = module_1(input_1)\nintermediate_2 = module_2(input_2)\noutput  = module_3(nn.Concatenate([intermediate_1, intermediate_2], axis = 1))\n“But it would be unfeasible to do this because I’d have to write a line for each input and process 8,868 in total… or would it?”\nThis should have seemed like a totally unreasonable thing to do and been where I stopped to think if there was another way to get a speed increase (or tested this by writing a tiny neural net by hand with and without caching results and looked for a tiny difference in speed). However, years ago I met a class deadline by using python2 to write python2 code so this seemed perfectly feasible.\nSo the plan became :\n\nGenerate a boat load strings containing python code\nUse Python’s exec() and eval() functions to run each string\nSit back and think about what a clever idea it was having my code write my code.\n\nSeveral hours later I’ve learned a fair bit about how exec() and eval() handle scope and that their behavior between python2 and python3 has changed and still have no working model. So I decide to print the code I wanted executed to the console paste it (all 8,868 lines of it) into my model definition, and run it.\nThis solution was inelegant but quick to implement and exactly what needed to happen because the model didn’t perform any better. If anything it was slower, so there definitely wasn’t any ☆Pytorch magic☆ happening. This was a big enough surprise that it got me to question if the model was the problem after all instead of running down other rabbit trails."

    "text": "So where’s the problem?\nBuilding a model may be the most evocative part of the data science workflow, but the steps that precede it are often as or more important. Choices around how to handle missing or potentially unrepresentative data are important as are how data is stored and moved around. In this case, I wasn’t thinking about these critical choices.\nFor each individual, there are data for genes throughout its genome (x_list, a list where each entry is a gene’s SNPs), and it’s trait of interest (y). Here’s the (simplified) code for this data set:\nclass ListDataset(Dataset):\n    def __init__(self, y, x_list):\n        self.y = y \n        self.x_list = x_list\n        \n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self.y)\n    \n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        # Get the data for index `idx`\n        y_idx =self.y[idx]\n        x_idx =[x[idx, ] for x in self.x_list]\n        \n        # Move to GPU so model can access it\n        y_idx.to('cuda')\n        x_idx = [x.to('cuda') for x in x_idx]\n        return y_idx, x_idx\nDo you spot what’s happening? When __getitem__ loads an observation, it has to move data from each gene to the GPU. This process isn’t instantaneous and is happening for each of the 6,067 genes every time an observation is loaded.\nTraining a network with a mere 100 observations (batch size of 10) takes 101.89s/it but if all the data is moved to the GPU before its 15% faster at 86.34s/it.\nThat’s nice, but since there are over 80,000 observations, it’s not enough to make training this model feasible. There’s another place we can look for improvements, and that’s the batch size. Increasing the batch size will mean that more observations are being moved to the GPU at a time so it has to happen fewer times. In this example getting all training observations in a single batch makes training 86% faster at 13.44s/it."

In essence your spreadsheet becomes a personal work history database from which you can quickly retrieve entries relevant to the application at hand.\nIf instead all your experiences went into an all encompassing text document, tailoring a document to a position would require you to go through each section and cut out most of the entries. To be clear – there are far worse strategies out there. Having a single reference document keeps your information together and means that much of your formatting work is done ahead of time.\nThis is where RStudio comes in. Rmarkdown gives you a way to draw entries from your spreadsheet, filter them, and then turn those entries into beautifully formatted text. Not to mention that you can have R update text for you1."

Earlier this month when a paper of mine was accepted. To update my documents I…\n\nedited the positions.csv document and added a row with the paper’s bibliographic information and url.\nopened my Rmarkdown files Curriculum-Vitae.Rmd and Resume.Rmd and knit them to pdfs.\ncopied the output pdfs to a second repository to share with others\ncommited and pushed these new documents to GitHub (and then did the same for the cv repository)\n\n\nYou might be wondering – what’s with the last two steps? Why move the documents and then push to GitHub instead of keeping them where they are? And why put these on GitHub in the first place?\nPutting these on GitHub (or online for that matter) makes it easy to go from your resume to your online presence (LinkedIn, Orcid, personal website, etc.) from links in your resume. This means that if you embed a link to your resume in your resume then every paper copy you hand out and every business card links to the most up to date version.\n\nUsing a second repository is just to have a cleaner presentation. Every file that isn’t your resume is a distraction – and if your recipient wants to see your GitHub they’ll be just one click away."

Several categories might be presented together (e.g. national_presentations and regional_presentations) but they aren’t assumed to be. The next column, in_resume, is a simple filter. Everything goes into the curriculum vitae, not so with the resume. Next we have institution. This one is a little odd because it includes university or organization names but also lists of authors (e.g. row 44). This is because all the items in this column are formatted the same way. After showing the title of an entry, we want to show this information. Dates are included using the start and end columns and location information (here urls) in loc. Finally, are several description_ columns. Extra information you want can be added to these.\n\nWhen I updated this spreadsheet I already had an entry from when I submitted the paper and put it $bioR\\chiiv$.\n\nOnly three cells had to change, moving it from the in review section to the academic articles section, tweaking the title, and updating the url.\n\nIn RStudio, the CV is ready to go. All I had to do was click the Knit button and wait for the pdf.\nThe resume took ever so slightly more work. For space and aesthetic reasons I use a non-default formatting for my publications. This is a manual step but is not hard at all. All I did was:\n\nRead in the position data and run line 433 position_data %&gt;% print_section('academic_articles'). This produces markdown formatted text. Each line of text is treated as a separate “item” and will be formatted according to some rules.\nCopy the markdown formatted text for the new publication.\nPaste it into the document and tweak the formatting:\n\nUse a smaller font size for everything between &lt;font size=\"1\"&gt; and &lt;/font&gt; .\nBold my name using ***\nDisplay authors and link together as the second line and don’t apply the third line’s formatting rules to anything (N/A)\n\n\n\nWith those edits made I click the “Knit” button again et voilà!

You don’t have to search through and count how many students you’ve mentored, or papers you published2.\nHere’s a simple example. I want to include how long I’ve been using R, but I don’t want to have to update that by hand. You could calculate this in R like so:\n\ntoday     &lt;- as.Date(format(Sys.time(), \"%Y-%m-%d\")) # Get today's date\nstart_R   &lt;- as.Date(\"2017-01-29\")                   # Set starting date\ndays_diff &lt;- difftime(today, start_R)                # Calc. days elapsed\nyears     &lt;- as.numeric(days_diff) / 365             # Convert to years\nyears     &lt;- round(years)                            # Round\nyears\n\nRMarkdown let’s you embed this calculation in the text.

Without the In the simplest conception, the jobs could listed (separated by a ;) and run from the command line and each would run in turn. This would not allow for modifying the queue however.\nFreeing up resources is and starting new jobs is more challenging. Ideally when the notebook finishes running it should release the resources but what if there’s an error or bug the process release them? In a notebook we could include os._exit(00) in the last cell to kill the process but if the notebook runs correctly this shouldn’t be an issue. As a fail safe I could keep an eye on what new programs are using the GPU and if they don’t release memory stop them with kill -9 $PID. Not a pretty solution (and if I start another process that uses the GPU, it could get killed) but it will work.\nLastly is a way to control the system. There needs to be a way to modify it’s state even if it’s running in the background. A simple way to do this would be to specify commands files in a specific location and naming convention."

I’ll need to parse the instructions, run the first job, check for new instructions, then run the next job and then repeat this until all jobs are complete. In between jobs, I’ll compare the processes running on the GPU and if any are not supposed to be there, stop them.\nI’ll keep track of the original state (nvidia_base_pids) of the GPU using a list of the PIDs that were running on it and current state as a dictionary (nvidia_state) which makes it easy to keep additional information for future use (e.g. how much memory is being used). The queue itself (ipynb_names) can be a simple list of the files to be run. These will need to be populated either from the GPU’s current state (with _init_nvidia()) or from the control files (with _parse_ctrl_jsons()). After that, the scheduler can begin working through the queued notebooks, controlled by the main() method.\nimport os, subprocess, re, json\n\nclass Scheduler():\n  def __init__(self):\n        self.background_mode = background_mode\n        self.nvidia_base_pids = []\n        self.nvidia_state = {}\n        self._init_nvidia()\n        self.ipynb_names = []\n        self._parse_ctrl_jsons()\n        self.main()\nThe GPU’s initial state needs to be recorded which I’ll do by reading all the processes running on it, and saving these PIDs.\n    def _init_nvidia(self):\n        self._read_nvidia()\n        self.nvidia_base_pids = list(self.nvidia_state.keys())\nFinding these processes takes a little doing. From the command line nvidia-smi produces a nicely formatted text table with this information. I’ve used subprocess to capture this information, and then I’ve parsed the table to get the relevant rows and put the information from each into a dictionary (in the list running_processes). Then each dictionary is saved in the self.nvidia_state under it’s process name.\n    def _read_nvidia(self):    \n        x = subprocess.run(\"nvidia-smi\", shell=True, check=True,  capture_output=True)\n\n        x = str(x).split('\\\\n')\n\n        table_blocks = [i for i in range(len(x)) if re.match('.+===+.+', x[i])]\n        table_breaks = [i for i in range(len(x)) if re.match('.+---+.+', x[i])]\n        process_row  = [i for i in range(len(x)) if re.match('.+ Processes: .+', x[i])]\n        start_line = [i for i in table_blocks if i &gt; process_row[0] ][0]\n        end_line   = [i for i in table_breaks if i &gt; process_row[0] ][0]\n\n        running_processes = [x[i] for i in range(start_line+1, end_line)]\n        running_processes = [dict(zip(\n            ['GPU', 'GI', 'CI', 'PID', 'Type', 'ProcessName', 'GPUMem'],\n            [e for e in line.strip('|').split(' ') if e != ''])) for line in running_processes]\n\n        for e in running_processes:\n            self.nvidia_state[e['PID']] = e\n\n\nReading controls\nNow it needs to read the control files. I’ll identify all the json files in ./SchedulerFiles/ that begin with ‘ctrl’ then run each in turn3. After a file is read the method will check if any of the keys are ‘info’ and return a help message4 if so. Then it will go through each key in order and modify self.nvidia_base_pids or self.ipynb_names accordingly. After a file is processed, it will delete it so that the system doesn’t get trapped in a loop – adding the same notebooks to the queue over and over.\n    def _parse_ctrl_jsons(self):\n        ctrl_files = [e for e in os.listdir('./SchedulerFiles/') if (re.match('ctrl.json', e) or re.match('ctrl\\d+.json', e))]\n        if len(ctrl_files) &gt;= 1:\n            for ctrl_file in ctrl_files:            \n                with open('./SchedulerFiles/'+ctrl_file, 'r') as f:\n                    data = json.load(f)\n\n                keys = tuple(data.keys())\n\n                if 'info' in keys:\n                    print(\"\"\"Text ommited for space\"\"\")\n                for key in keys:\n                    if 'nvidia_base_pids_add' == key:\n                        self.nvidia_base_pids += data[key]\n                    if 'nvidia_base_pids_del' == key:\n                        self.nvidia_base_pids = [e for e in self.nvidia_base_pids if e not in data[key]]\n                    if 'ipynb_names_read' == key:\n                        print(self.ipynb_names)\n                    if 'ipynb_names_add' == key:\n                        self.ipynb_names += data[key]\n                    if 'ipynb_names_next' == key:\n                        # technically this could be used to add files and set them to first\n                        self.ipynb_names = data[key]+[e for e in self.ipynb_names  if e != data[key]]\n                    if 'ipynb_names_del' == key:\n                        self.ipynb_names = [e for e in self.ipynb_names if e != data[key]]\n                \n                # remove the file\n                os.unlink('./SchedulerFiles/'+ctrl_file)            \n\n\nRunning the next job\nNow there’s a way to add jobs to the queue there needs to be a method to run them. This method will check if there’s a file to be run, if it exists, and if so use subprocess to run it in the appropriate conda virtual environment.\n    def _advance_queue(self):\n        if len(self.ipynb_names) == 0:\n            pass\n        else:\n            ipynb_name = self.ipynb_names.pop(0)\n            if os.path.exists(ipynb_name) == False:\n                pass\n            else:\n                process = subprocess.Popen(\n                    f\"conda run -n gpu_env jupyter execute {ipynb_name}\".split(), stdout=subprocess.PIPE\n                    )\n                output, error = process.communicate()\n\n\n\nThe main loop\nNow I can use these methods to process all the items in the queue. As long as there are items to process, it will use _advance_queue() to process the one at the front of the queue. Next it will check if there are any new commands to process. Then it will check if the GPU state matches expectations. If there are any PIDs using the GPU that are not listed in the nvidia_base_pids list these will be stopped. Once the queue is exhausted, the script will stop.\n    def main(self):\n        while len(self.ipynb_names) &gt; 0:\n            print(f'Running {self.ipynb_names[0]}')\n            self._advance_queue()\n            # allow for external controls\n            self._parse_ctrl_jsons()\n            self._read_nvidia()\n            # kill all the processes that were not running at the start. \n            for gpu_pid in [e for e in self.nvidia_state.keys() if e not in self.nvidia_base_pids]:\n                subprocess.run(f'kill -9 {gpu_pid}', shell=True)\n        print('No more queued ipynbs. Exiting.')\n\nAll together (and possible improvements)\nThis system works nicely for how quick it was to write up5. There are plenty of improvements that could be made. Suppose you wanted this to run in the background and idle until you added a new job to the queue. One could imaging changing the main() method to achieve this and extending _parse_ctrl_jsons() to get the system to stop idling and shut down. Or suppose you wanted to queue different file types or run notebooks in different environments – _advance_queue() could be extended to do this. Finally, suppose you don’t want to manually exempt PIDs that aren’t using much of the GPU’s resources. Each PID’s usage is available in the nvidia_state dictionary of dictionaries under GPUMem, so a threshold could be set.\nThese changes and other customization for your use case are left as an exercise for the reader.\nEdit 2023-12-20: I’ve added a background mode and option to begin the main loop directly on initialization.\nimport os, subprocess, re, json,  time\nclass Scheduler():\n    def __init__(self, background_mode = False, run_main = False):\n        self.background_mode = background_mode\n        self.exit = False\n        self.nvidia_base_pids = []\n        self.nvidia_state = {}\n        self._init_nvidia()\n        self.ipynb_names = []\n        if run_main:\n            self.main()\n\n\n    def _init_nvidia(self):\n        self._read_nvidia()\n        self.nvidia_base_pids = list(self.nvidia_state.keys())\n\n    def _read_nvidia(self):    \n        x = subprocess.run(\"nvidia-smi\", shell=True, check=True,  capture_output=True)\n\n        x = str(x).split('\\\\n')\n\n        table_blocks = [i for i in range(len(x)) if re.match('.+===+.+', x[i])]\n        table_breaks = [i for i in range(len(x)) if re.match('.+---+.+', x[i])]\n        process_row  = [i for i in range(len(x)) if re.match('.+ Processes: .+', x[i])]\n        start_line = [i for i in table_blocks if i &gt; process_row[0] ][0]\n        end_line   = [i for i in table_breaks if i &gt; process_row[0] ][0]\n\n        running_processes = [x[i] for i in range(start_line+1, end_line)]\n        running_processes = [dict(zip(\n            ['GPU', 'GI', 'CI', 'PID', 'Type', 'ProcessName', 'GPUMem'],\n            [e for e in line.strip('|').split(' ') if e != ''])) for line in running_processes]\n\n        for e in running_processes:\n            self.nvidia_state[e['PID']] = e\n    \n    def _parse_ctrl_jsons(self):\n        ctrl_files = [e for e in os.listdir('./SchedulerFiles/') if (re.match('ctrl.json', e) or re.match('ctrl\\d+.json', e))]\n        if len(ctrl_files) &gt;= 1:\n            for ctrl_file in ctrl_files:            \n                with open('./SchedulerFiles/'+ctrl_file, 'r') as f:\n                    data = json.load(f)\n\n                keys = tuple(data.keys())\n\n                if 'info' in keys:\n                    print(\"\"\"\nThis scheduling tool uses json files to modify its state while running. \nIt will look for json files beginning with 'ctrl' and containing 0 or more digits in \n./SchedulerFiles/ and then run each.

Maybe you have your email in the acknowledgements or maybe you make business cards with a qr code to your website.\nThese are good steps but we can go further. Let’s make qr code that nudges people to send an email. I’ve used this to good effect for getting emails of people who would like to be notified when a software project goes live.\nHere’s the plan: 1. Give people your email. 2. Make it easy for them to send you an email. 3. Encourage them to do it now.\nTo accomplish this we’re going to create a mailto link and encode it as a qr code. mailtos are opened in your default mail application so this gets the address where it’ll be used with zero typing. We’ll add some suggested text to the email. This gives the user a starting point and gives us a default subject line to search for later.\nHere’s what this looks like in R. After setting the email and default subject and body text the spaces are replaced with %20 (20 is the ASCII hexdecimal code for space). We concatenate these strings together and then use the marvelous qrcode library to make a graphic that’s ready for a poster, presentation, or card.\n\nlibrary(qrcode)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.0     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nemail    = 'your.name@usda.gov'\ninp_subj = 'Re: Envriomental Deep Learning Presentation'\ninp_body = 'Hello from the conference...'\n\n\ninp_subj = str_replace_all(inp_subj, ' ', '%20')\ninp_body = str_replace_all(inp_body, ' ', '%20')\n\ninp_text = paste0(c(\n  '&lt;a href=\"mailto:',email,'?&subject=', inp_subj, '&body=', inp_body, '&gt; &lt;/a&gt;'\n), collapse = '')\n\nplot(qrcode::qr_code(inp_text))"

    "text": "Today we’re going to look at building a container to run a GWAS1 on a computing cluster. Container construction can be rigorous and necessitate a fair bit of understanding but we can get a lot of the benefits without, say, doing everything we can to make the container small enough to run on the idea of a computer.\nWe’ll start by looking at a simple script to run GWAS with GAPIT. We need only install tidyverse and GAPIT so our container will be simple.\nInstead of Docker we’re going to use singularity (aka apptainer) to avoid needing root access – which we won’t have on an HPC. We begin by creating a definition file with installation instructions for our analysis’ dependencies. Happily, we can build off the Docker ecosystem which lets us avoid a lot of steps by simply using an image from the rocker project with R installed. Additional dependencies are installed as if we were working on the linux command line2.\nNext we build the container. If you have root access the first command will work. Otherwise try the second. The machine that builds the container will need internet access. I’d recommend using a local machine to build this (if you’re on windows, take a look into the Windows Subsystem for Linux ). Depending on the HPC you’re using there might be a node set aside on the HPC for this (using the login nodes for this sort of thing is not recommended – it can interfere with other people accessing it).\nAfter you’ve moved your files and the container to the HPC you can open a shell in the container. This shell should still have access to the host’s files (but here’s a link to how to bind baths in case it doesn’t). From there you can start R in interactive mode or launch the R script."

First we check how many lines are in the file with wc and then use tail to all but the top line. This updated queue we save to a temp file and then use mv to overwrite the queue file. We have to write an intermediate file because the pipe &gt; will activate before tail resulting queue being overwritten with an empty file.\n# find the lenght of the queue so it can be shortened\ntmp=($(wc --lines ./queue.txt))\nnlines=${tmp[0]}\n\n# This the pipe runs before tail so we have to use a temp file and then rename it.\ntail -n $((nlines -1)) queue.txt &gt; queue.tmp && mv queue.tmp queue.txt\nNow we can parse the paths into a directory name we can make use of. We’ll do this by using sed to replace text in this string to remove the directory information ( s|./.*/|| ) and file extension (e.g. s|\\.hmp\\.txt|| ). These file names we’ll concatenate into the name of the output directory ($save_dir).\n# create a new save location\n# remove the ./dir/ and .txt \nphno_name=$(echo $phno_path |sed 's|\\./.*/||' |sed 's|\\.txt||')\ngeno_name=$(echo $geno_path |sed 's|\\./.*/||' |sed 's|\\.hmp\\.txt||')\n\nsave_dir='./output/'$phno_name'__'$geno_name\nThe R script writes its output into the working directory so we’ll make a directory for this set of parameters, cd into it, and copy the template script in.\nmkdir $save_dir\n\n# change pwd \n# copy gwas.R to the save dir\ncd  './'$save_dir\ncp ../../gwas.R ./gwas.R\nUsing sed again, this time with the inplace option -i, we swap out the placeholder paths with a new path relative to the working directory.\n# modify the paths with a leading '.' to be '../'\n# use sed to replace the run settings\nsed -i 's|./hmp_phno.txt|../.'$phno_path'|' ./gwas.R\nsed -i 's|./geno.hmp.txt|../.'$geno_path'|' ./gwas.R\nWith those changes made we can execute this script using the singularity container gapit.sif in the root of the project.\nsingularity exec ../../gapit.sif Rscript ./gwas.R &gt; run.out\nHere’s the whole script all together.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ngeno_path=$(head -n 1 queue.txt |awk '{print $1}')\nphno_path=$(head -n 1 queue.txt |awk '{print $2}')\n\n# find the lenght of the queue so it can be shortened\ntmp=($(wc --lines ./queue.txt))\nnlines=${tmp[0]}\n\n# This the pipe runs before tail so we have to use a temp file and then rename it.\ntail -n $((nlines -1)) queue.txt &gt; queue.tmp && mv queue.tmp queue.txt\n\n# create a new save location\n# remove the ./dir/ and .txt \nphno_name=$(echo $phno_path |sed 's|\\./.*/||' |sed 's|\\.txt||')\ngeno_name=$(echo $geno_path |sed 's|\\./.*/||' |sed 's|\\.hmp\\.txt||')\n\nsave_dir='./output/'$phno_name'__'$geno_name\nmkdir $save_dir\n\n# change pwd \n# copy gwas.R to the save dir\ncd  './'$save_dir\ncp ../../gwas.R ./gwas.R\n\n# modify the paths with a leading '.' to be '../'\n# use sed to replace the run settings\nsed -i 's|./hmp_phno.txt|../.'$phno_path'|' ./gwas.R\nsed -i 's|./geno.hmp.txt|../.'$geno_path'|' ./gwas.R\n\nsingularity exec ../../gapit.sif Rscript ./gwas.R &gt; run.out"

I’ve saved this as run_gwas.sbatch.\n# ... \n# Your node settings here\n# ...\n\nmodule load apptainer\nbash 02_next.sh\nNow we can put it all together. First run 01_mkqueue.sh to build the queue and then run sbatch run_gwas.sbatch over and over.

If you have genomic data, perhaps you use 3 genotypes and 1000 SNPs to start off with. Of if you want to work with hyperspectral images maybe you begin with a single channel and low resolution. After you are comfortable with this reduced data you can take what you’ve learned and apply it to the larger dataset.\nAfter you’ve chosen a dataset you’ll need to select a task to complete. These tend to fall into the categories of classification, regression, and distribution modeling. You should also consider if you want your model to be generative. For many scientific applications we don’t but that shouldn’t limit your imagination!\nFor example let’s say I have a small dataset of mRNA abundances for a few (&lt;200) cells of several cell types. I could try to predict cell type from mRNA counts (classification). Instead I might try to predict some mRNA abundance from other mRNAs’ abundances (regression). Or I could try to detect outliers or measure how dissimilar different cell types are (distribution modeling). With this last approach I could try to produce new observations of mRNA abundances given a cell type1 (generative).\n\nAlternative: Implement a different model using torch\nSince neural networks implement linear operations followed by a non-linear transformation you could try…\n\nImplementing a generalized linear model\nBuilding about a really big linear model\nFitting a linear model with a loss function other than mean squared error\n…"

    "title": "Summer Session: Meeting 6 Preparation Notes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Below are a few notes regarding the lecture for the next two sessions (Building a GPT).\nFirst, if you’re looking for a good break point for next week, 38m and 1h1m are good stopping points. By the first point you’ll have seen the Bigram model we worked on weeks ago remade in Pytorch and by the second you’ll have gotten a good preview of some the ideas that will be key in the second half of the video.\nSecond, there are a few potential points for confusing where Python is acting in a way that’s not necessarily intuitive. Karpathy uses a Lambda expressions to define a few functions. Lambdas are handy because they are very terse but this can make them unclear. Here I’ve written out one of these function definitions three ways from most terse to least to show what’s happening here.\n# chars is a list of the unique characters \n# ['\\n', ' ', '!', ...  'y', 'z']\n\n# We've seen a dictionary comprehension previously\n# {'\\n': 0, ' ': 1, '!': 2, ... 'y': 63, 'z': 64}\nstoi  = {s:i for i,s in enumerate(chars)}\n\n# Defining a function by naming a lambda\nencode = lambda s: [stoi[c] for c in s]\n\n# Alternate version\ndef encode1(s):\n    return [stoi[c] for c in s]\n\n# Alternate verson without the list comprehension\ndef encode2(s):\n    out = []\n    for c in s:\n        out.append(stoi[c])\n        \n# Confirm these functions are equivalent\nfor x in ['chars']:\n    print(f'{encode(x)}\\n{encode1(x)}\\n{encode2(x)}')\n\n# [41, 46, 39, 56, 57]\n# [41, 46, 39, 56, 57]\n# [41, 46, 39, 56, 57]\nLater, in the Bigram model class definition there’s a point in the method that generates new tokens (characters) that uses self(idx). What’s happening is that the default method of the class is being called. This default method is what you want to happen when you pass data to the class, so here we want to pass in some sequence and get the next entry in the sequence. We talked about pytorch nn.Module a little last week, but the key idea to know here is that the forward() method makes predictions (it does the forward pass). Thus self(idx) would be the same as writing self.forward(idx) but the former assumes more knowledge of pytorch-isms.\nclass BigramLanguageModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        # ...\n\n    def forward(self, idx, targets=None):\n        # ... \n    \n    def generate(self, idx, max_new_tokens):\n        for _ in range(max_new_tokens):\n            logits, loss = self(idx) # &lt;--- !\n            # ...\nFinally, there are a few points where you may want to stop and compare tensors. For me it’s easier to get a sense of what’s going on by plotting part of the tensors instead of printing them. To do this you can take a 2d slice of the tensor (below we have a 3d tensors so we’re looking at the 0th batch), convert them to numpy arrays and then plot them with plt.imshow(). When comparing two I like to either subtract them (so they’re all 0s if they’re the same) or concatenate them with a spacer and plot them together. Here is example code to do this:\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.imshow(np.concatenate([\n  x[0].numpy(),       # Slice of a tensor\n  np.zeros((T, 1))-1, # Spacer matrix of -1s\n  xbow[0].numpy()     # Slice fo a tensor\n], axis = 1))\nNow we can quickly see that the left two slices are different and the right two are equivalent."

    "section": "",
    "text": "“Do Nothing Scripting” is a great practice. In brief the idea is to begin with a script that prints the instructions for a task but does not execute the instructions. Rahter it waits until the user presses a key or otherwise confirms that the task has been completed. Think of it like a check list – it contains the instructions and will display them as you complete them.\nIn our lab the main languages we use are python, R, and bash. In each of these languages the following functions would suspend the script until the user is ready to proceed.\n# python\ndef wait_for_enter():\n    input(\"Press a key to continue.\")\n    \nwait_for_enter()\n# R\nwait_for_enter &lt;- function(){\n  readline(prompt = \"Press a key to continue.\")\n}\n\nwait_for_enter()\n# bash\nwait_for_enter(){\n echo \"Press a key to continue.\"\n read -n 1 INVALUE\n}\n\nwait_for_enter\nDo nothing scripting can allow for steps that may change to be dynamically updated as in this example of in the rootbot sorting script. The jupyter notebook prints out instructions for the user to complete externally.\nprint(\"\"\"Instructions:\n1. Go to \"\"\"+path_base+'Experiments/'+experiment+\"\"\"\n2. Run rsync -azv --files-from=./send_files.txt ./ ../dest/\n   or if remote -azv --files-from:=./send_files.txt ./ ../dest/\n\"\"\")\nIt also allows for steps in that process to be automated over time. A step can begin as a list of instructions and ultimately be replaced by a function or external script."

    "text": "QR Codes for Easier Record Keeping\nFor certain tasks in the lab we use QR code to label plants, samples, or other materials. Generating these can take a bit of doing, so we have a few simple scripts to do this. Ideally, we want to make our labels both machine and human readable so we will produce labels with text alongside the QR code.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(qrcode)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nmk_qr_label &lt;- function(\n    plot = 1,\n    field = 1,\n    pedigree = 'CM48',\n    max_len = 12,\n    output_dir = './output/'\n){\n  # clean inputs\n  plot     &lt;- as.character(plot)\n  field    &lt;- as.character(field)\n  pedigree &lt;- as.character(pedigree)\n  \n  # info to be embedded\n  label &lt;- paste(c(field, '_', pedigree), collapse='')\n  \n  # Set up save name\n  savename  &lt;- paste(plot, field, stringr::str_replace_all(label,  '/', '\\\\'), \n                     sep = '_')\n  save_path &lt;- paste(output_dir, savename, \".svg\", sep = '')\n  \n  # create qr code\n  code  &lt;- qr_code(label)\n  \n  # reshape for ggplot\n  code_long &lt;- pivot_longer(mutate(\n    X = seq(1, nrow(as.data.frame(code))),\n    as.data.frame(code)), \n    cols = starts_with('V')) %&gt;% \n    mutate(Y = -1*as.numeric(str_remove(name, 'V')))\n  \n  # create text for ggplot\n  align_label &lt;- paste(\n    c(plot, \n      paste0(rep(' ', max(c(0, (max_len - stringr::str_length(pedigree)))))),\n      field, \n      paste0(rep(' ', max(c(0, (max_len - stringr::str_length(field)))))),\n      pedigree), collapse = '')\n  \n  # make plot\n  plt &lt;- ggplot(code_long)+\n    geom_tile(aes(X, Y, fill = value))+\n    annotate(geom = \"text\", \n             x = min(filter(code_long, value)$X), \n             y = -1, \n             label = align_label,\n             hjust = 0, \n             size = 11\n    )+\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c('white', 'black'))+\n    theme_void()+\n    theme(legend.position = '')+\n    coord_equal()\n  \n  return(list('qr'=plt, 'path'=save_path))  \n}\n\nUse of this function is straight forward. It accepts numeric or text data for the plot, field, and pedigree of a plant. To ensure these attributes are positioned in a way that is easy to read, max_len adds spaces after each (up to the number specified). This results in text that is separated cleanly. The function returns a plot of the QR and the expected location for it to be saved. This will enable future extensions such as writing a batch of qr codes to a word document with officer for easy printing.\n\noutput_list &lt;- mk_qr_label(\n    plot       = 1,\n    field      = 1,\n    pedigree   = 'CM48',\n    max_len    = 12,\n    output_dir = './output/'\n)\n\nprint(output_list$path)\n\n[1] \"./output/1_1_1_CM48.svg\"\n\noutput_list$qr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse for batch processing is simple. We need to read in a spreadsheet with the label information and ensure that there are no missing values.Then we can loop over the entries and pass the output of mk_qr_label into ggsave and it will save them to the output directory.\n\nlabels &lt;- read_excel('./Grain_Labels_Demo.xlsx')\n\n# overwrite key fields with character version and add in missing labels for NAs\nwalk(c(\"Plot\", \"Field\", \"Pedigree\"), function(e){\n  labels[[e]] &lt;&lt;- as.character(labels[[e]])\n  labels[is.na(labels[[e]]), e] &lt;&lt;- 'MISSING'\n})\n\nfor(i in seq(1, nrow(labels))){\n  output_list &lt;- mk_qr_label(\n    plot       = labels[i, 'Plot'],\n    field      = labels[i, 'Field'],\n    pedigree   = labels[i, 'Pedigree'],\n    max_len    = 12,\n    output_dir = './output/'\n  )\n  ggsave(filename = output_list$path,\n         plot     = output_list$qr\n  )\n}"

    "text": "There’s an unresolved memory leak in the imaging script on the Rootbot. Overtime it consumes ever more ram until the script is killed. Ideally we should rewrite the script or monitor it using systemd so that the script is automatically restarted when it crashes. This has not risen to the top of the todo list so the current work around is as follows:\n\nAbout half way through an experiment, ssh into the rootbot’s pi.\nCheck that pictures aren’t currently being taken by looking at the timestamps in the pictures directory (ls -lh ~/Pictures)\nFind the process id number (PID) for the script (\nrootBotPhotoScript_23Feb2021.py\n) (e.g. with top or htop)\nEnd the process with kill $pid where $pid is the value from step 3.\ngo to the folder with the script (cd \\~/rootbot/jupyter_notebooks).\nRestart the rootbot script (rootBotPhotoScript_23Feb2021.py). Don’t be fooled by the shebang line, python3 must be explicitly used. The command to do this is nohup python3 rootBotPhotoScript_23Feb2021.py &&. nohup and && ensure the process continues in the background after the terminal is closed. python3 ensures the system’s default python (2) isn’t used. The full path need not be provided for the script because the present working directory is the /jupyter_notebooks folder."
