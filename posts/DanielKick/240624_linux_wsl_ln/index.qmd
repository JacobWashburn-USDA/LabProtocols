Modern Windows machines can give you access to Linux command line tools via the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). On launch the present working directory is set to the subsystem's home rather than a location in the main Window's file structure.

``` bash
$ pwd
/home/<user>
```

The main file structure is in `/mnt/` so if you're for example, trying to pattern match and zip a few files *getting there* is a bit of a pain. The quick solution is to create symbolic links (shortcuts) between the two.

The syntax for symbolic links is `ls -s source target`.

``` bash
$ ln -s /mnt/c/Users/<UserName>/Desktop Desktop
$ ln -s /mnt/c/Users/<UserName>/Documents Documents
$ ln -s /mnt/c/Users/<UserName>/Downloads Downloads
$ ls
Desktop Documents  Downloads 
```

After creating these links we `cd` into them and end up in the main system and keep just a little more momentum than we otherwise would
