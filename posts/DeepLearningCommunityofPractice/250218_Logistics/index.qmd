## Overview

This week we talked about non-deep learning tasks that are necessary for effective modeling. 

- Data cleaning and storage
  - Pandas, Polars, and Databases
- Model evaluation and test set construction
  - Structure in the data and information leakage
- Case Study: Workflow to predict viral infection potential
  - Separating data prep from modeling
  - Using cross validation folds stratified with respect to species
  - How do we think about predicting cases that were not observed?
  - Example pipeline
- Tracking Hyperparameters and Experiments
  - General workflow
  - KerasTuner, Ray, and Ax
  - Example in Ax
